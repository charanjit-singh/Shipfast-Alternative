# Shipfast Alternative

Looking for a Shipfast alternative to streamline your web app development? While Shipfast offers a solid boilerplate for quick setups with authentication and payments, there’s a better option for developers needing more flexibility and features: [**Indie Kit**](https://indiekit.pro?utm_source=github&utm_campaign=shipfastalternativerepo). For those on a budget, **OpenSaaS** is a free alternative worth checking out.

## Why Indie Kit?

Indie Kit builds on Shipfast’s foundation but adds powerful tools for solo devs, small teams, or B2B apps:
- **Quota & Plan Management**: Easily manage subscription tiers and feature access.
- **Modern UI**: Uses Shadcn for sleek, customizable designs (vs. Shipfast’s DaisyUI).
- **Plan-Based Features**: Lock/unlock features based on user plans:
  ```typescript
  const { currentPlan } = useCurrentPlan()
  if (!currentPlan?.quota.canUseApp) {
    // Hide features
  }
  ```
- **Background Jobs & Emails**: Ideal for SaaS or AI projects.
- **Super Admin Tools**: Manage users and plans effortlessly.
- **SEO & Secure APIs**: Built-in tools for discoverability and security.
- **Multi-Tenancy**: Supports multiple organizations natively.

## Indie Kit vs. Shipfast

Shipfast is great for fast starts, but Indie Kit offers more advanced features, a better UI toolkit, and great value. It’s actively supported by a growing community.
